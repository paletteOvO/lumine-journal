# Lumine

A markdown extension for dairy, planning and todo based on remark without introducing new syntax/keyword to allow most markdown preview software can handle it correctly.

Transforming planning of previous day to today's todo by
`node src/index.js -- <markdown path> <target date in YYYY-MM-DD>`

Setting up a cron task to allow auto generation.

Look at the examples folder for more information about format.
